1- This Casino game code is a simple number guessing game with a betting system. Here's a brief description of the code:

3- The program includes necessary header files for input/output, standard library functions, and time-related functions.
4- It declares three functions: rules() for displaying game rules, round1() for handling the first round of the game, and main() as the entry point of the program. 
5- The main() function calls the rules() function to display the game rules, followed by the round1() function to execute the first round of the game.
6- The round1() function prompts the user to enter their name, deposit an initial amount, and place a bet on guessing a number between 1 and 10.
7- After the user's input, the program generates a random number as the computer's choice, compares it with the user's guess, and determines whether the user wins or loses
. 8- If the user wins, the program calculates the new balance based on the winnings and displays the result. If the user loses, it adjusts the balance accordingly and prompts the user to decide whether to continue playing or not.
9- If the user chooses to continue playing, the program goes through another round with adjusted parameters, and the process repeats.
